# Breast Cancer Classification 🧬

This repository contains machine learning projects for classifying breast cancer tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using diagnostic features.  
It demonstrates a full data science workflow — from **data preprocessing** and **exploratory analysis** to **model training**, **evaluation**, and **comparison**.
